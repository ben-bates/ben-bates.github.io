I am a Research Fellow at Harvard Law School's [Program on Corporate Governance](https://pcg.law.harvard.edu/). My research focuses on corporate and securities law, and I use empirical methods to study risks to investors in public and private markets. My most recent work studies funds that give retail investors access to private market investments. Some of my other work examines the ways that boards of directors control the shareholder voting process in public companies.

I am on the job market during the 2025--26 academic year. You can find my job market paper, *Retail Access to Private Markets*, [here](https://ben-bates.github.io/files/Bates - Retail Access to Private Markets.pdf).
