**Abstract:** In recent years, asset managers have launched dozens of products that provide ordinary investors with access to private market investments. Sponsors are promoting these funds as a way to “democratize” private markets and give everyday savers an unprecedented opportunity to diversify their portfolios and earn attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, the funds combine features of private funds and mutual funds in ways that create unique risks for investors.

In this paper, I explore the rise of these new “retail private funds” and the accompanying risks to investors. I study these funds’ legal structures and analyze data collected from their public filings. First, I present evidence that the new funds, like private funds, report very low return volatility that understates their risk. However, because the new funds admit less sophisticated investors and provide periodic liquidity at their reported net asset values, the underreported volatility presents greater investor protection concerns than in private funds. Second, I provide suggestive evidence that some products that are restricted to wealthier investors perform better than products sold more broadly. This performance gap raises the possibility that sponsors are channeling products with poor performance to investors with low financial sophistication and little wealth.

I conclude by discussing legal and policy changes that would give retail investors the tools they need to avoid being taken advantage of as they invest in the new funds. As policymakers continue to consider ways to expand access to private markets, they should grapple with the risks I highlight and plan ways to mitigate them.
